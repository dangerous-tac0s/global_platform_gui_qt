# Global Platform GUI
A quick attempt at GUI wrapper for [Global Platform Pro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) by 
[Martin Paljak](https://github.com/martinpaljak) geared towards the [flexSecure](https://dngr.us/flexsecure).
Tons of credit go to [@Stargate01](https://github.com/stargate01), [@GrimEcho](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/u/grimecho/summary), and [@pilgrimsmaster](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/u/pilgrimsmaster/summary).
