        ### By [SatoChip.io](https://satochip.io/)

        Satochip stands for **S**ecure **A**nonymous **T**rustless and **O**pen **Chip**.
        It is a javacard applet that can be used as a secure hardware wallet.
        The Satochip applet has full BIP32/BIP39 support.

        Using Satochip, an initial BIP32 seed is imported in the javacard and private
        keys are derived as requested by an external application.
        *Private keys are never exported outside of the secure chip*.

        Access to private keys is enforced through the use of PIN code (4-16 chars).
